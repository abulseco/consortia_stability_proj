# Consortia Stability Project (Metcalf 2019)

#### Updated 08/06/2019 - Ashley Bulseco

This code is specific to an undergraduate Metcalf research project that aims to investigate the stability of a microbial consortia isolated from salt marsh sediments over time. This work is in collaboration with J. Bowen and J. Vineis of Northeastern University. This workflow uses Illumina-utils and resolves nodes using minimum entropy decomposition from [Eren et al. 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej2014195). 

### 1. Requirements for this workflow
* Illumina-utils found [here](https://github.com/merenlab/illumina-utils) 
* Oligotyping pipeline found [here](http://merenlab.org/2014/08/16/installing-the-oligotyping-pipeline/)
